      <h2>Job Experience</h2>

      <div class="job-experience">
        <h3>Sami Apps [2016-2017]</h3>
        <p>I worked (internship) for 8 months in a kids content focused company in which we developed eBooks or learning applications for children. Thanks to this experience, my curiosity for web development started waking up. I learned HTML5, JS, JQuery among other web technologies.</p>
        <h3>Giesecke & Devrient [2018-2020]</h3>
        <p>Company based on Smart Cards manufacturing and developing. Here I got a 3 year experience where I learned a lot about the embedded systems field as well as a lot of specifications that our products were compliant with. Some of them are the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>GSMA. Specifically, SGP02 and SGP22</li>
          <li>ETSI / 3GPP</li>
          <li>GlobalPlatform and some ammendments</li>
          <li>ISO 7816</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A part from specifications, I also got familiar with memory management and low level technologies (C, Assembly, ISO Protocol layers like T=0 or T=1). Although my job was mainly developing features of the Smart Cards operating systems, I did my final degree project about the JavaCard Virtual Machine so I got a great knowledge about the interaction between the applications and the Smart Cards OS (I also developed some applications). During the first year, I became deputy Scrum Master of my team so I managed to make people comfortable and efficient as well as facilitating the daily work as much as I could. Due to my role as Scrum Master I gained and improve some soft skills.</p>
        <h3>Others</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Football referee</strong> in the Catalan Federation of Football. I reached the 3rd catalan regional division.</li>
          <li><strong>Roses seller</strong> during "Sant Jordi" day in Barcelona.</li>
          <li><strong>Freelancer</strong> helping with Unity problems as well as other troubleshooting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Degree in Computer Engineering [2015-2019]</h3>
        <p>I graduated in computer engineer on September 2019 in the Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona.</p>
        <h3>English</h3>
        <p>I obtained my C1.2 level in the official languages school of Barcelona and the First Certificate in English (FCE) by Cambridge exam. I am fluent and surely I will do the C2 exam soon.</p>

            <h3>C</h3>
            <p>Due to C is a low level programming language and my experience is with embedded products which must be optimal and maximize their runtime efficency, this is the language I am most experienced at.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="skill-row">
            <h3>C++</h3>
            <p>I can also consider myself experienced at C++ because I used it a lot to test the already done implementations.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="skill-row">
            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p>I have a great knowledge of Java because in the embedded world, a great number of applications make use of JavaCard technology which is an adapted version of Java for embedded systems.</p>

            <h3>WebDev</h3>
            <p>I wouldn't say I am experienced at Web development but I am continuously learning owing it is something I like. This site is an example of my knowledge.</p>
